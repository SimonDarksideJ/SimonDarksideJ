## üëã Hi, I Am Simon "Darkside" Jackson

- I am a developer focusing on Mixed Reality Solutions and the MetaVerse.
- I have published several Unity titles, including [Mastering Unity 2D Game Development](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-Unity-2D-Game-Development/dp/1849697345) and [Unity UI Essentials](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00T96XBYI), more to come in 2023!!
- I built the Microsoft [Mixed Reality Toolkit V2](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/tree/releases/2.8.3) (with friends) and then evolved to the [XRTK](https://github.com/xrtk) and eventually the [Reality Toolkit](https://realitycollective.io/), further evolving multi-platform XR development.
- I also maintain and publish the [Service Framework](https://service-framework.realitycollective.io/) (in the Reality Collective) which is the best and most performant way to build projects in Unity.
- I have been a [Microsoft Mixed Reality MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001069?fullName=Simon%20Jackson) since 2014 (Since 2004 with the change in programs)
- I am honored to be one of the first [Microsoft Game Development Ambassadors](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/community/ambassadors/) since the program launched in 2021, helping devs with the MS Game Dev stack.
- For several years I have been an Xbox MVP helping the dev community get up and running with publishing to Xbox/Windows.  Sadly the program is being retired in 2023 and being replaced with another Ambassador program. (hoping to join that journey too)
- I publish and maintain the [Unity UI Extensions](https://github.com/unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uiextensions) project, packaging up the best the community has to offer for Unity UI components, utilities and "stuff".
- I blog "fairly" regularly on my [Personal blog](https://darkgenesis.zenithmoon.com/) about all things game development related or just cool tech.
- Amongst the various public projects I have worked on (sooo many) the one I was most proud of is the [Fizzyo project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-fizzyo/), making games and a game framework to gamify the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis for kids, so much fun.
